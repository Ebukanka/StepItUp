  const updatedCart = addToCart(cart, item);
  expect(updatedCart).toContain(item);
);

•	Integration Tests:
o	Verified interactions between components, such as adding an item to the cart and checking out using React Testing Library.
•	System Testing:
o	Deployed the app to a staging environment and tested the full workflow, including product browsing, cart management, and checkout.
•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
o	Gathered feedback from test users.
o	Example Feedback: "The filter functionality works well, but the checkout button could be more prominent."
